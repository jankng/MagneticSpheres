General TODO:
- outline of thesis (chapters, which results to include)
- acquiring results
- creating imagery
- think of other configurations to investigate


parameters to vary:
- starting config: optimal chain
- number of spheres: 5 to 40
- maximum distance of end links
- metropolis parameters
- gravitational constant
- symmetric dipole orientation (mirroring on/off)
- allow negative coordinates (growing chain left to right)


improve results:
- flatten out dipole orientation with conjugate gradient algorithm
- readjust spatial coordinates


how to procede:
 - 10 iterations for each set of parameters.
 - then, should the 10 iterations yield different results, do more
 - after metropolis do conjugate gradient.

setting up parameters:
 - symmetric dipoles on/off
 - allow negative coordinates and minimum distance of end links on/off
 - vary n of spheres from 5 to 50
 - maximum step size = n, n/8, n/80
 - starting height = n
 - vary gravity from 0.01 to 1
