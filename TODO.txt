Important:
- correct energy function (gravity is erroneously divided by n as of now)

General TODO:
- outline of thesis (chapters, which results to include)
- acquiring results
- creating imagery
- think of other configurations to investigate


parameters to vary:
- starting config: optimal chain
- number of spheres: 5 to 40
- maximum distance of end links
- metropolis parameters
- gravitational constant
- symmetric dipole orientation (mirroring on/off)
- allow negative coordinates (growing chain left to right)


improve results:
- flatten out dipole orientation with conjugate gradient algorithm
- readjust spatial coordinates
